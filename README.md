# ArmstrongNumber
Check whether a number is an Armstrong number

Problem 5: Armstrong number

A number is called an Armstrong number if it is equal to the cube of its every digit. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because of 153= 1+ 125+27, which is equal to 1^3+5^3+3^3. You need to write a program to check if the given number is Armstrong number or not.
Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework.
